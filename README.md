Code Institute Portfolio 4 Submission

# The Gaming Blog
This website was made using ideas from the Assessment Guide that I was given, Project Example Idea 2 to example looked like this:

**Site owner's goal:**
-   The site owner would like to create a discussion community.
**Potential features to include:**
-   Posts can be up/downvoted
-   Comments can be left on a post
-   Time/Date of posting
-   Topic groupings/categories

I incorporated the possible features that were discussed, such as like a post, publishing time/date, and categorizing each post. 

Overall, I made a gaming community website where they can debate all the hot subjects in the globe regarding the newest releases in games, consoles, hardware, you name it! I designed/styled this website using the famous bootstrap, which really helped me near the conclusion of my project because the whole Python/Django stuff had taken up a lot of my time; I still struggle with it today, I won't lie, but it was great being put on the spot.

My major goal was to develop a good responsiveness website that looked nice and worked well across all devices, and bootstrap was my hero once again.

## Page Responsiveness

I tested the responsiveness across all layouts, including Android phones, tablets, and website displays. The majority of the styling is from Bootstrap since I appreciate how simple it is to make responsive websites with the code they offer. I also utilized Django's forms and stylized them again to my preference.
